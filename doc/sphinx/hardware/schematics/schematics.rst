Schematic and Board Layout
==========================

Board layout and schematic files for the BMS-Master, the BMS-Extension, the BMS-Interface and the BMS-Slave
are available on their dedicated `GitHub repository <https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-hardware>`_.

To open them, please download `Eagle <https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview>`_.
This repository also contains the bill of material (BOM) and a pdf version of the schematics.
As the BMS-Master and BMS-Extension were designed as one unit, the schematic may include blank pages.

.. note::

   For board production, the provided BOM in the corresponding repository must be used. Before sending the board layout
   to a PCB manufacturer, the layout files must be checked against the design rules provided by this manufacturer, as some
   board layout settings may depend on these design rules and may cause clearance violations (e.g., pad layout).
