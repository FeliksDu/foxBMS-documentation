How to use this documentation
-----------------------------

The complete |foxBMS| documentation is available and maintained in HTML, PDF and EPUB formats.

.. note::
   
      A search function is available under the |foxBMS| logo in the HTML version of the documentation.

How to generate the HTML documentation and set up |foxBMS| rapidly
----------------------------------------------------------------

First, the software getting started guide explains how to generate the complete HTML generation and how to configure the software.
Then, the flashing getting started guide explains how to supply the hardware and how to flash the |foxBMS| program on |MCU0| and |MCU1| located on the |BMS-Master| in the |Master|.

If these steps are done, |foxBMS| already runs. The last step is longer because connectors must be made. In this last step,
it is explained how to prepare the other parts of the |foxBMS| hardware.


Where can the layout and schematic files be found?
--------------------------------------------------

The layout and schematic are available in the HTML documentation in the section Hardware documentation, in :ref:`hw_layout_schematic`.
